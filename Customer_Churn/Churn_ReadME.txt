Customer Churn Predictive Model 

Project Introduction: 
Growth is measured by net new subscribers, which would imply that there is a loss of existing customers[1].  It is this referred to as churn that is a great source of revenue loss and should be addressed.  It is cheaper to hold onto customers rather than accrue Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) [2].  This project will look at several Machine Learning model approach to find if it is possible to predict if a current customer is at risk of churning. 

Methods Used: 
 This project will start off using Exploratory Data Analysis to get a handle on the data and its shape and relationships.  This will be followed by: 
Data Wrangling/ processing 
Feature Engineering 
Model evaluations 
Ensemble Technique.   

Technologies: 
This project will use the following technologies and approaches 
It will be written in Python 3 
Jupyter Notebooks 
Pandas
Numpy

Project Description 
Problem Statement:
The cost of acquisition of new customers is considerably higher than the retention of existing customers.  The bank is wanting to lower the churn rate of it is current clientele there by increase itâ€™s net new subscriber growth rate which in turn will have a positive impact on the stakeholders in the bank.  A predictive model will be developed that will look at all current customers and those that have left withing the last 6 Months  (assuming this will be a sufficient data set size) with the idea that it will be able to predict the likelihood that a given set of parameters will indicate a customer is likely to churn, thereby causing management to act and retain the customer. 

Methods 
	There will be several methodologies used in the building and implementation of a model.  Several machine learning algorithms will be used and there recall, accuracy, F1 and Chi^2 scores will be compared to find witch is the best fit for the data and predicting churn.
